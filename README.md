# Smart System

## * What is our smart system?
Our smart system consists of three main modules , It is first
job that controls is to adjust the room temperature
whenever it is hot It will automatically turn hot the Air
conditioner or a custom cooler system and if when the
temperature goes back to normal acceptable temperature it
will automatically turn the cooler off and also we made a
room to control a custom heater system it will turn on when
the temperature gets too cold till it setls down and go back
to normal.
And then we supposed that our system is made for houses
so we made one more additional thing , we wanted to make
something to control the existence of the water in the water
tank automatically so that no one needs to turn the water on
if the tank is empty and when the tank gets full the water
should stop flowing to the tank .
Last but not least we made it possible for us to monitor
what happens in our system in the current moment so we
installed an LCD to that data on it , On the LCD it displays
the information like the current room temperature and if the
heater or the cooler is on , it also displays the current water
level of the water tank whether the water pump is on or off.
